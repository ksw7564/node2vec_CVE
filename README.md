# node2vec_CVE

node2vec Backup material

data_file is CVE -> Pretreatment

# 5yr.py
Use this file to create a node2vec model.
This file uses a machined dataset file (five_cos.csv, 5 year_inverted.csv).

The node2vec generation variable was determined by a number of experiments that I think are most accurate.

And tried to interact with distant nodes by taking advantage of the graph's characteristics.

# elbow.py and visualize_silhouette.py
These files were used to find K in proper clustering of models.
The result was hopeless.
There was no good evaluation of K and it was constant.
So I decided because I thought there were about 20 types of security vulnerabilities.
